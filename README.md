THis is a libc for WASM for those who lothe Emscripten and their build script monstrocity. This you can compile with `clang` without much fuss. There are a few gotchas but not like DEBUGGING EMSCRIPTEN. Also this generates ONLY WASM not webpages. However, to help you along there is a bootloader and SPA template available.
